# Neovim/Vim tips, tricks, shortcuts & resources

## Tips & Tricks
* Just like in VSCode, you can [fold](#folding) blocks and even _lines_ of code in neovim.

## Shortcuts
#### Folding
  * fold _range_ lines based on motion. __Tip:__ If you want to fold a block of code, place the
    cursor on the opening of the block (e.g., '\<p\>', '{}'), then press keys _zf%_ one after another. \
    `{range}zf{motion}`
